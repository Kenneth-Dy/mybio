  Hello my name is Ken Dy and currently the games I'm playing are NBA 2K21 and Hades. 
  2K is a basketball game that is known for its predatory practices but yet I still play it. 
  Hades is a rouge-like game centered around dying repeatedley and slowly improving by learning the game mechanincs.
  Another game I recently finished was CyberPunk 2077 which is an RPG about a dystopian future where money matters more than lives.
